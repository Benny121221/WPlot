# Creating a Scatter Plot

Signal plots can be created in a similar way.

# Prefab Signal Plots
WPlot lets you use a couple premade signal plots, just plug in a frequency and hit OK.

## You can create a signal plot from your own data if you need. The process is nearly identical to a Scatter Plot

# Easy Customization

Toggle gridlines, ticks, frame, or just choose a pretty theme:

You can also add labels or choose a logarithmic axis:
