# WPlot
A WPF app for plotting stuff. The backend is provided by [ScottPlot](https://github.com/swharden/ScottPlot)

# Capabilities
Currently this is quite basic, it supports scatter plots (with error bars and regression) and signal plots. It also has robust customization settings.

# Creating a Scatter Plot

Signal plots can be created in a similar way.

# Prefab Signal Plots
WPlot lets you use a couple premade signal plots, just plug in a frequency and hit OK.

## You can create a signal plot from your own data if you need. The process is nearly identical to a Scatter Plot

# Easy Customization

Toggle gridlines, ticks, frame, or just choose a pretty theme:

You can also add labels or choose a logarithmic axis:
